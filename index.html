    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Omar Hesham, originally from Egypt but having spent most of my life in Kuwait. I graduated with an IGCSE
        from The Future International School and am currently a Computer and Communication Engineering student
        at the University of Alexandria with a GPA of 3.69. As a programming enthusiast, I'm keen on gaining more
        hands-on experience in coding while also focusing on enhancing soft skills to maximize my potential as both
        a coworker and a programmer.
